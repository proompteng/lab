<!-- Concrete end state (behavior, UX, infra state). -->

## Scope
- In scope:
  - <!-- Directories/codepaths Codex may touch (e.g., services/facteur/**). -->
- Out of scope:
  - <!-- Explicitly list items that must NOT change (e.g., prod config, infra, migrations). -->

## Constraints & Risks
<!-- Hard constraints (security, performance, deadlines), known risks, or required approvals. -->

## Rollout / Ops Notes
<!-- Describe deployment sequencing, Argo workflow triggers, or coordination needed with other teams. Mention feature flags or toggles. -->

## Validation
- [ ] <!-- Command(s) + expected outcome. -->
- [ ] <!-- Add all required checks (lint, tests, smoke, docs). -->

## Codex Prompt
<!-- Provide the exact prompt Codex should use. Be explicit about scope and output format. -->

## Additional Context
<!-- Logs, screenshots, Argo workflow runs, or Discord threads that provide extra colour. -->
