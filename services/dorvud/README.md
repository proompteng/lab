# Dorvud (placeholder)

Multi-project Kotlin service scaffold aligned to the Dorvud design outline. Modules:
- `platform`: shared foundations and configuration placeholders.
- `technical-analysis`: stub for analytics logic.
- `websockets`: stub for realtime gateway.
- `flink-integration`: stub for Flink job/integration wiring.

Each module currently exposes a minimal placeholder function and builds with Gradle 9.2.0 / Kotlin 2.2.21.
