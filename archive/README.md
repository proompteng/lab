# Archive

This directory contains deprecated/outdated runbooks and manifests kept for historical
reference.

Rules:

- Nothing under `archive/` should be referenced by ApplicationSets or active runbooks.
- If you need something from here, copy the relevant parts into the active docs/manifests
  and update them to match current cluster standards (GitOps first, no deprecated features).
