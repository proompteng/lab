Keep artifactId/workflowId null and write generatedAt in RFC 3339 format. Follow the scoring heuristics and citation policy in this entry for confidence assignments.\n\nInputs:\n- vendorSignals: vendor announcements about shipments, calibration, or support windows.\n- testCoverage: signals about test rack throughput, certification runs, or new metrology equipment.\n- serviceRequests: service calls, replacement orders, or maintenance visits that may delay instrumentation.\n\nReturn no prose outside the JSON object defined by expectedJsonEnvelope.",
