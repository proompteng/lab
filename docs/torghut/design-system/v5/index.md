# Torghut Design System v5: Production Quant + LLM Strategy Build Pack

## Status
- Version: `v5`
- Date: `2026-02-22`
- Maturity: `production-quality design pack`
- Scope: 5 prioritized new-feature strategy builds plus whitepaper synthesis plus crypto pipeline migration design plus multi-account execution migration design

## Purpose
This pack expands the top 5 strategy priorities into implementation-grade designs with:
- explicit architecture and data contracts,
- deterministic safety boundaries,
- rollout, rollback, and SLO gates,
- verification plans and acceptance criteria,
- direct citations to original white papers.

## Non-Negotiable Invariants
- `paper` remains default mode; live requires explicit gates and approval token flow.
- deterministic risk/kill-switch controls remain final authority.
- LLM components can propose, critique, and abstain but cannot bypass deterministic execution policy.
- each promotion decision must include reproducible evidence artifacts.

## Why This Sequence
- uncertainty gates are foundational controls for every downstream model path.
- TSFM routing/refinement upgrades signal quality once gating exists.
- execution intelligence captures realized PnL improvements by lowering slippage/impact.
- fragility-aware allocation protects tails before wider autonomy.
- committee-style LLM orchestration is highest complexity and should sit on hardened controls.
- two-speed pipeline operationalizes continuous intake while keeping production promotion strictly gated.
- full-autonomy design should be evaluated as an advanced track after two-speed controls are proven.
