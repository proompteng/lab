  "rationale": "QuantEval is strong as an execution-grounded benchmark design with explicit deterministic configuration and clear failure criteria, making it suitable for repository integration as an offline evaluation gate. However, paper limitations (small coding subset, fixed backtest assumptions, residual leakage uncertainty) and current repo gaps (no native QuantEval schema/runner) mean it is not sufficient basis for immediate production trading automation.",
  "rejection_reasons": [
    "Reject direct promotion of QuantEval gains to autonomous live trading decisions without broader robustness and regime validation.",
    "Reject one-to-one implementation claims until a repository-native QuantEval adapter (task schema, runner, and failure taxonomy) exists and is tested.",
    "Reject interpreting benchmark score deltas as economic edge without additional execution realism and out-of-distribution checks."
  ],
  "recommendations": [
    "Implement QuantEval as a deterministic offline evaluation lane in `services/torghut` with immutable manifests and reproducible metrics.",
    "Add CTA-style executability/failure-taxonomy checks aligned to Appendix B.2 and report category-level failure counts.",
    "Gate any model promotion on repeated-run stability and cross-regime checks beyond the fixed benchmark assumptions.",
    "Track benchmark metrics as governance signals, not direct trading directives, until independent production validation is complete."
