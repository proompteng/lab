  "rationale": "ATLAS presents a clear and implementable architecture for sequential prompt adaptation in agentic trading workflows, and results are directionally strong in difficult bearish/volatile conditions. However, narrow evaluation scope, deterministic execution assumptions, low run count, and non-universal superiority across all model/regime cells make immediate autonomous production deployment unjustified.",
  "rejection_reasons": [
    "Reject immediate autonomous live-trading deployment due to simulator realism gaps (slippage, latency, partial fills, intraday microstructure not modeled).",
    "Reject broad production claims until robustness is shown beyond three assets and one two-month window.",
    "Reject confidence in universal superiority because some model/regime cells do not outperform static baselines.",
    "Reject high-confidence rollout without higher-powered repeated-run statistics and significance analysis."

  "recommendations": [
