  "executive_summary": "ATLAS combines a multi-agent market-analysis stack with a central trading agent and introduces Adaptive-OPRO, a sequential prompt-optimization method using rolling-window performance feedback. The strongest evidence is in bearish/volatile conditions where Adaptive-OPRO often converts negative baseline returns into positive outcomes, but external validity is constrained by narrow scope (three assets, one two-month period), deterministic simulator execution, and low run count.",
  "problem_statement": "LLM trading agents need to integrate heterogeneous signals and adapt policy under delayed, noisy feedback without breaking execution interfaces or drifting into unstable behavior.",
  "methodology_summary": "The framework separates market intelligence from execution, using market/news/fundamental analyst agents that feed a central trading agent producing order-level actions. Adaptive-OPRO optimizes only the static instruction block of the central agent over rolling K=5-day windows, with score mapping s=clip[0,100](50+250*ROI), while preserving placeholders and output schema. Evaluation spans three regimes (LLY, XOM, NVDA), seven model backbones, three runs per setting, and compares baseline, reflection, and Adaptive-OPRO strategies.",
