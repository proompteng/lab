  "rejection_reasons": [
    "Reject immediate full-production deployment because assumptions behind theoretical guarantees are not validated for the target trading regime.",
    "Reject direct strategy promotion because experiments are narrow (single market/year) and mainly directional in reported results.",
    "Reject live-capital usage without stronger backtest realism controls (costs, slippage, turnover, robustness)."

  "recommendations": [
    "Implement the two-loop architecture in shadow mode with full artifact capture and deterministic replay metadata.",
    "Add strict promotion gates: walk-forward robustness, cost-aware performance, turnover and drawdown limits.",
    "Introduce KB governance: provenance hashes, deduplication, retirement/decay of stale patterns.",
    "Run ablations for inner-loop only, outer-loop only, and full loop to verify incremental benefit in-house.",
    "Require human approval for any transition from paper trading to live execution."
