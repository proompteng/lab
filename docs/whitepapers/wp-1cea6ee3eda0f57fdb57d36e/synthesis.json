  "executive_summary": "QuantAgent proposes a two-layer self-improving LLM architecture (inner writer-judge loop + outer real-feedback loop) for financial signal mining. The framework is coherent and implementation-relevant, but claims of provable efficiency rely on strong imported assumptions, and empirical evidence is primarily directional rather than numerically rigorous.",
  "problem_statement": "How to autonomously build and integrate high-quality domain knowledge for LLM agents in specialized domains such as quantitative trading without heavy manual curation.",
  "methodology_summary": "The inner loop iteratively refines outputs using KB retrieval, writer generation, and judge scoring until threshold or step limit. The outer loop evaluates outputs in a real environment and appends feedback to KB. The analysis models the inner loop as an MDP and combines inner and outer loop efficiency arguments via sublinear regret decomposition.",
