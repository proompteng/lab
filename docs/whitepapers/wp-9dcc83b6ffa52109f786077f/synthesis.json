  "executive_summary": "The paper combines LLM alpha generation with PPO-based dynamic alpha weighting. Reported results show strong outperformance versus market benchmarks for Apple, HSBC, Pepsi, and Tencent, but clear underperformance for Toyota. The approach is useful as a research prototype for adaptive signal blending, but production viability is constrained by leakage risk, small-universe evaluation, and limited statistical rigor.",
  "problem_statement": "Recent LLM studies generate useful formulaic alphas but typically use static integration schemes. The paper targets dynamic, market-adaptive integration of multiple LLM-generated alphas through reinforcement learning.",
  "methodology_summary": "The authors generate 50 formulaic alphas with deepseek-r1-distill-llama-70b from price, technical, and sentiment features, then optimize alpha weights with PPO in a POMDP setup. State includes OHLCV, previous position, regime filter, and rolling volatility. Actions are clipped and L1-normalized alpha weights. Reward is position P&L minus transaction cost. Evaluation compares PPO against equal-weight alpha portfolios and market indices using IC/MI diagnostics plus return, Sharpe, and drawdown.",
