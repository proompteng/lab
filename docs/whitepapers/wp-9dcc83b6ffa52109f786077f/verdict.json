However, possible leakage in alpha-generation workflow, limited evaluation breadth, and weak statistical validation materially reduce confidence for production deployment.",

    "Reject production promotion without walk-forward, multi-regime validation on a broader asset universe.",

  "recommendations": [
    "Implement as a deterministic internal research module for adaptive alpha weighting.",
    "Enforce train-only alpha generation and immutable data/split manifests.",
