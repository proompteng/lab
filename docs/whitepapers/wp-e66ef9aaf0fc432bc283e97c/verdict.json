  "rationale": "The paper provides a useful architecture pattern for iterative self-improvement with real feedback, but practical confidence is limited by assumption-heavy theory and narrow empirical scope. It is suitable for controlled research deployment with strict auditability and gating, not immediate autonomous production trading.",
  "rejection_reasons": [
    "Reject immediate full-production rollout because the theoretical guarantees depend on assumptions that are not validated for non-stationary market conditions.",
    "Reject autonomous live usage because empirical evidence is mostly directional and lacks robust statistical uncertainty reporting.",
    "Reject direct strategy promotion without broader regime validation and production-grade execution-friction controls."
  ],
  "recommendations": [
    "Implement the two-loop architecture in deterministic shadow mode with complete artifact capture.",
    "Require walk-forward, cost-aware robustness gates before any promotion decision.",
    "Run explicit component ablations and repeated-seed evaluations with confidence intervals.",
    "Add KB governance controls (quality scoring, dedupe, provenance checks, decay/retirement).",
    "Keep human approval mandatory for any transition beyond paper trading."
