  "executive_summary": "QuantAgent presents a two-loop self-improving LLM architecture for quantitative signal mining: an inner writer-judge refinement loop and an outer real-environment feedback loop. The architecture is practically useful, but claims of provable efficiency rely on strong assumptions, and empirical evidence is mainly directional, making immediate full production deployment unjustified.",
  "problem_statement": "How to improve domain-specific LLM agent performance in quantitative trading by continuously integrating generated outputs and real evaluator feedback into a reusable knowledge base.",
  "methodology_summary": "The inner loop iterates retrieval, drafting, and judging against a context buffer and knowledge base (Algorithm 1). The outer loop evaluates final candidates in a real environment and ingests outcomes back into the knowledge base (Algorithm 2). The paper formalizes the process as an MDP, provides sublinear regret claims for inner and outer loops under assumptions, and combines them into an overall regret bound.",
