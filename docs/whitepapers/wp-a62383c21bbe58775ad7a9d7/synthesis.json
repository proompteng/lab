  "executive_summary": "P1GPT proposes a five-layer multi-agent LLM workflow that fuses technical, fundamental, and news signals into auditable buy/sell/hold decisions. The architecture is implementation-relevant for structured orchestration and traceability, but empirical claims are not sufficient for production trading because evaluation scope is narrow and execution assumptions are simplified.",
  "problem_statement": "How to design a scalable, explainable multi-agent LLM system that can integrate heterogeneous financial modalities into actionable trading decisions.",
  "methodology_summary": "The framework processes data through Input, Planning, Analysis, Integration, and Action Decision layers. Domain-specialized and supporting agents produce standardized reports that are fused via rule-based and LLM-based synthesis with optional conflict-resolution loops. Evaluation uses backtests on AAPL/GOOGL/TSLA (Feb-Sep 2025) against rule-based baselines under frictionless single-position execution assumptions.",
