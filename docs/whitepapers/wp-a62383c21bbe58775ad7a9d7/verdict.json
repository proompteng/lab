However, the paper's performance evidence is not sufficient for direct production trading due to narrow evaluation scope and simplified backtest assumptions that omit key execution frictions.",

    "Reject immediate live-capital deployment: transaction costs, slippage, and portfolio interactions are not modeled.",
