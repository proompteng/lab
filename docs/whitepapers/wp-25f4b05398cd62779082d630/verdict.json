  "rationale": "FinPos provides implementation-useful structure for position-aware LLM trading systems: persistent exposure state, dual-stage decision decomposition, and CVaR-constrained sizing with multi-timescale reward shaping. However, autonomous production viability is not established because statistical uncertainty quantification is limited, execution-friction realism is incomplete, reproducibility manifests are not exhaustive, and external validity is constrained by single-asset framing and prompt sensitivity.",
  "rejection_reasons": [
    "Reject immediate autonomous live deployment due to missing production-grade fees/slippage/latency/impact assumptions in headline evaluations.",
    "Reject production promotion without confidence intervals and stronger repeated-window robustness analysis.",
    "Reject broad generalization claims from current single-asset setup and limited stock universe.",
    "Reject high-stakes deployment until deterministic replay manifests (data/prompt/config lineage) are complete."
  ],
  "recommendations": [
    "Implement FinPos as a reproducible research harness with explicit position-state accounting and auditable decision traces.",
    "Add deterministic manifests: prompt hashes, data snapshot hashes, model/runtime pins, and run provenance metadata.",
    "Re-run all baselines under identical friction-aware assumptions and standardized prompt/output constraints.",
    "Require walk-forward multi-regime testing with uncertainty intervals before any deployment expansion.",
    "Restrict operational mode to analyst-assist or paper trading with hard risk controls and manual oversight."
