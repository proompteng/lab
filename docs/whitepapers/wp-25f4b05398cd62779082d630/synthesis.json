  "executive_summary": "FinPos proposes a position-aware LLM trading architecture built on three coupled mechanisms: market-signal processing with hierarchical memory, dual-stage decisions (direction plus quantity/risk), and multi-timescale reward shaping (1/7/30-day trends). In-paper experiments report consistent gains over listed baselines, but production autonomy is not justified yet because statistical uncertainty, execution-friction realism, reproducibility manifests, and external validity remain insufficient.",
  "problem_statement": "Most prior LLM trading-agent setups use direction-only single-step tasks that liquidate positions each step, preventing explicit exposure continuity and limiting risk-aware long-horizon strategy learning.",
  "methodology_summary": "The paper reframes trading as a position-aware task with persistent position state and return computation over held exposure. FinPos then combines (1) filtering plus analysis agents for noisy multi-source market text, (2) a dual decision architecture where direction and sizing/risk are separated, and (3) a multi-timescale reward used in simulation-time training to reinforce trend-aligned and risk-aware behavior. Position sizing is capped with rolling 20-day CVaR.",
