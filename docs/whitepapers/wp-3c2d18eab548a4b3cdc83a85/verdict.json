  "rationale": "AlphaAgentEvo provides a clear, implementation-usable architecture for trajectory-level alpha evolution with explicit reward decomposition and strong reported benchmark outcomes. The current repository has compatible deterministic trading-research and gating infrastructure, but lacks key paper-parity components (AST expression evolution runtime and ARL training loop). Because statistical uncertainty and deterministic replay details are insufficiently specified in-paper, adoption should proceed as a controlled research implementation rather than immediate autonomous production promotion.",
  "rejection_reasons": [
    "Reject immediate autonomous production deployment due to missing confidence intervals and repeated-seed significance evidence for headline metrics.",
    "Reject production promotion without deterministic replay manifests (prompt/config/seed/data hashes) that can reproduce key tables exactly.",
    "Reject parity claims until AST-expression evolution and multi-turn ARL training components exist in the current Torghut runtime.",
    "Reject broad market generalization claims until additional regime and universe robustness checks are completed."
  ],
  "recommendations": [
    "Implement AlphaAgentEvo concepts as a deterministic research extension inside Torghut's existing backtest/evaluation lane.",
    "Prioritize trajectory logging, AST similarity controls, and reward-term auditability before model-scale optimization.",
    "Add uncertainty-aware reporting and explicit promotion gates in autonomy policy checks.",
    "Keep operational mode at research/paper trading with human oversight until robustness and reproducibility gates pass."
