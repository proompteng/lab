  "executive_summary": "QuantaAlpha reframes LLM-based factor mining as trajectory evolution with controllable factor construction and explicit mutation/crossover operators. The reported CSI 300 results are strong versus baselines, and transfer curves on CSI 500/S&P 500 are promising. Practical adoption is viable for research infrastructure, but production readiness is limited by uncertainty reporting and reproducibility gaps.",
  "problem_statement": "Existing LLM agent pipelines for alpha mining suffer from fragile controllability, limited trust lineage across iterations, and constrained exploration under noisy non-stationary markets. The paper addresses this with trajectory-level evolutionary optimization and generation-time controls.",
  "methodology_summary": "The system generates hypotheses, realizes factors through symbolic operator expressions and AST-backed code generation, applies consistency/complexity/redundancy gates, and evaluates factors via backtesting. It then evolves mining trajectories through diversified initialization, localized mutation, and reward-driven crossover to improve terminal reward over iterations.",
