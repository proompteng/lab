  "rationale": "The paper provides an implementation-actionable architecture for trajectory-level evolutionary factor mining with clear operator definitions and positive ablations. However, production confidence is constrained by missing uncertainty quantification, incomplete deterministic replication detail in the manuscript, and limited execution-friction realism.",
  "rejection_reasons": [
    "Reject immediate autonomous production deployment because headline gains are presented without confidence intervals or significance testing.",
    "Reject direct production promotion until deterministic reproduction artifacts (prompt/seed/code/data manifests) are available and validated.",
    "Reject high-stakes rollout without deeper execution-friction stress tests beyond current backtest assumptions.",
    "Reject broad generalization claims until additional out-of-period and multi-market robustness checks are completed."
  ],
  "recommendations": [
    "Implement trajectory archival, mutation/crossover operators, and symbolic constraint gating as a deterministic research framework.",
    "Add repeated-seed evaluations with confidence intervals and statistical significance tests for headline comparisons.",
    "Expand robustness testing to rolling windows and additional markets/assets beyond the paper's primary setup.",
    "Integrate slippage/impact and liquidity stress modeling before any live-trading consideration."
