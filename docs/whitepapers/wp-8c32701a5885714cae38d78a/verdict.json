  "rationale": "FinPos presents an implementation-relevant architecture for position-aware LLM trading decisions, with clear module boundaries (signal processing, direction, quantity/risk) and useful reward-design ideas. However, immediate autonomous production deployment is not justified because statistical robustness is limited, execution-friction realism is incomplete, prompt sensitivity is high, and the evaluation scope is narrow.",
  "rejection_reasons": [
    "Reject immediate autonomous live deployment due to missing production-grade transaction-cost/slippage/impact modeling in headline evaluation.",
    "Reject production promotion without confidence intervals and broader repeated-window robustness evidence.",
    "Reject broad generalization claims because experiments are single-asset oriented and concentrated on a limited stock universe.",
    "Reject high-stakes usage without stronger deterministic reproducibility artifacts (prompt/data/version manifests)."
  ],
  "recommendations": [
    "Implement the architecture as a reproducible research harness with explicit position-state simulation and auditable decision traces.",
    "Add deterministic manifests: prompt hashes, data snapshot hashes, dependency versions, and run provenance.",
    "Re-evaluate all methods under identical execution-friction assumptions and standardized baseline prompt constraints.",
    "Run walk-forward multi-regime tests with confidence intervals before any promotion beyond paper trading.",
    "Maintain hard risk controls and manual oversight for all non-simulated usage paths."

    "Execute regime-stratified testing (bull, bear, sideways) and report uncertainty bands.",
    "Extend from single-asset decisions to constrained portfolio simulation with concentration and turnover limits.",
    "Audit baseline fairness where setup descriptions differ (for example backbone declarations versus runtime model statements)."
