  "executive_summary": "FinPos proposes a position-aware LLM trading-agent architecture that combines hierarchical market-signal processing, a dual decision policy (direction plus quantity/risk), and a multi-timescale reward mechanism. Reported experiments show strong in-paper gains versus listed baselines, but immediate production viability is constrained by limited statistical robustness reporting, incomplete execution-friction realism, prompt sensitivity, and single-asset scope.",
  "problem_statement": "Most prior LLM trading agents are framed as discrete daily direction tasks that do not explicitly model persistent holdings, making risk-aware exposure management and long-horizon strategy formation difficult.",
  "methodology_summary": "The paper formalizes a position-aware task with carry-over position state, then implements FinPos with three modules: market-signal processing (filter plus analyst agents with hierarchical memory), dual trading decisions (direction and quantity/risk), and multi-timescale reward shaping (1, 7, 30 days). Quantity sizing is constrained by rolling CVaR and agents use reflection loops to update memory relevance.",
