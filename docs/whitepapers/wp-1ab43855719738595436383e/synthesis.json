  "executive_summary": "The paper contributes a practical LLM+MCTS architecture for symbolic alpha mining, where multi-dimensional backtest signals guide iterative formula refinement and Frequent Subtree Avoidance mitigates structural collapse. In-scope experiments show strong relative gains and efficiency, but production viability is constrained by missing statistical confidence reporting, incomplete reproducibility packaging, and limited execution-realism stress evidence.",
