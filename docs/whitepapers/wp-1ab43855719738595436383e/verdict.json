  "rationale": "The paper presents a technically coherent and implementation-useful search architecture (LLM-guided MCTS with FSA) and reports strong in-scope gains, but evidence is not yet sufficient for unrestricted production deployment due to limited uncertainty reporting, incomplete reproducibility packaging, and execution realism gaps.",
  "rejection_reasons": [
    "Reject immediate full live deployment because key result uncertainty (confidence intervals/significance/multi-seed variance) is not adequately reported.",
    "Reject direct production rollout because deterministic reproducibility artifacts are incomplete for strict audit replay.",
    "Reject unconstrained execution because robustness under stronger slippage/impact and stress-regime assumptions remains under-validated."
  ],
  "recommendations": [
    "Implement the architecture in a deterministic research pipeline with immutable run manifests and prompt/config hashes.",
    "Require rolling-window and multi-seed significance validation before promotion.",
    "Add strict risk and cost realism gates (turnover, impact, concentration, drift alarms) before any live usage.",
    "Use paper-trading/shadow deployment as the default operating mode until all gates pass."

  "requires_followup": true,
  "follow_up_actions": [
    "Reproduce core benchmark tables with fixed seeds and publish variance bands.",
    "Run transaction-cost and slippage sensitivity sweeps with stress scenarios.",
    "Add blinded human interpretability evaluation to reduce evaluator circularity.",
    "Verify cross-market stability with longer and more recent out-of-sample windows."
