Theoretical guarantees rely on assumptions that are not validated for deployment conditions, and empirical support is directional with limited breadth.",

    "Reject immediate full-production rollout because key theoretical assumptions (implicit Bayesian inference and pessimistic transfer) are not validated for the target market regime.",
    "Reject direct live-capital promotion because reported experiments are narrow (single market, 2023 horizon) with limited quantitative ablations in the main text.",
    "Reject uncontrolled deployment without explicit cost-aware risk controls (slippage, turnover, drawdown, exposure constraints)."

  "recommendations": [
    "Implement the two-loop architecture in shadow mode first, with full artifact capture and reproducibility metadata.",
    "Add deterministic promotion gates based on walk-forward robustness and cost-aware metrics.",

    "Introduce KB governance policies (deduplication, scoring, decay, provenance hashing).",
    "Require human review sign-off for any transition from paper trading to live execution."
