  "executive_summary": "QuantAgent introduces a two-loop self-improving LLM architecture (inner writer-judge loop plus outer real-environment feedback loop) for quantitative signal mining. The architecture is implementation-relevant, but its provable efficiency and practical efficacy are contingent on strong assumptions and limited empirical scope.",
  "methodology_summary": "The inner loop iteratively retrieves knowledge, generates candidate outputs, and applies judge feedback until threshold or step cap. The outer loop evaluates candidates against a higher-fidelity environment and appends feedback into KB. Theory models this as an MDP and composes inner and outer regret bounds under assumptions.",
