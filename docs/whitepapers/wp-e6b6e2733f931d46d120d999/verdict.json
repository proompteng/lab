  "rationale": "Trading-R1 provides an actionable architecture for structured financial reasoning and decision shaping, including clear stage-wise rewards and volatility-aware labeling. However, unresolved split/leakage ambiguity, missing statistical uncertainty reporting, regime concentration, and limited execution-friction realism make it unsuitable for immediate autonomous production trading.",
  "rejection_reasons": [
    "Reject immediate live autonomous deployment due to unresolved temporal split/leakage ambiguity and incomplete reproducibility artifacts.",
    "Reject production promotion without repeated-seed significance evidence and uncertainty bounds for reported gains.",
    "Reject unconstrained execution because robustness outside mega-cap bull-regime conditions is not demonstrated.",
    "Reject high-stakes usage without production-grade slippage/impact/turnover modeling and hard risk controls."
  ],
  "recommendations": [
    "Implement the staged structure->evidence->decision training pattern as a deterministic research pipeline.",
    "Publish immutable split manifests and enforce anti-leak CI assertions on all dataset builds.",
    "Run repeated-seed walk-forward evaluations with confidence intervals and bootstrap significance tests.",
    "Expand evaluation to cross-regime and broader universes (including small/mid-cap and non-tech-heavy slices).",
    "Keep deployment in analyst-support plus shadow/paper-trading mode until robustness gates are satisfied."

    "Quantify sensitivity to transaction costs, slippage, turnover limits, and alternative holding horizons.",
