  "executive_summary": "Trading-R1 introduces a staged finance-reasoning training recipe (structure, evidence, decision) over a 4B model with SFT plus GRPO-based RFT, using a 100k multi-modal corpus and volatility-normalized five-class labels. Reported backtests are directionally strong against listed baselines, but production viability is constrained by split/reproducibility ambiguity, missing statistical rigor, and limited regime diversity.",
  "problem_statement": "General LLMs and existing reasoning models are not reliably aligned to structured, auditable, and market-grounded trading decisions under noisy multi-source financial inputs.",
  "methodology_summary": "The system combines multi-source data collection (news/technicals/fundamentals/sentiment/macro), reverse reasoning distillation for SFT targets, volatility-aware multi-horizon label generation (Algorithm S1), and three-stage reward shaping optimized with GRPO. Rewards explicitly score structure quality, evidence grounding, and asymmetric decision correctness.",
