  "rationale": "Janus-Q offers a strong implementation pattern for event-driven decision optimization, especially via HGRM and SFT->RL staging. However, current evidence is not sufficient for immediate live deployment due to scope limits, reproducibility gaps, and incomplete statistical robustness reporting.",
  "rejection_reasons": [
    "Reject immediate full-production deployment because evaluation evidence is concentrated in a single market and short primary horizon.",
    "Reject direct live-capital promotion because statistical significance and variance reporting are insufficient for high-confidence rollout.",
    "Reject unconstrained execution without stronger slippage/impact and turnover realism under stress regimes."
  ],
  "recommendations": [
    "Implement Janus-Q-style training and reward logic in a controlled research pipeline with deterministic replay metadata.",
    "Run walk-forward, regime-segmented, and cost-stress ablations with confidence intervals before promotion.",
    "Enforce hard risk gates: exposure caps, stale-signal suppression, drift alarms, and auto-disable conditions.",
    "Keep strategy in paper trading until performance stability and reproducibility thresholds are met across markets/horizons.",
    "Require human approval for any transition from paper to live execution."
