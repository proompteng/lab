  "executive_summary": "Janus-Q presents a two-stage event-driven trading pipeline: event-centric CAR-labeled data construction, then SFT plus GRPO with a hierarchical gated reward (HGRM). The strongest technical contribution is structured reward gating that ties semantic correctness to executable trading objectives. Reported results are strong in the provided setup, but production viability is constrained by external-validity and reproducibility risks.",
  "problem_statement": "Current trading systems underuse event-level semantics and often misalign language reasoning with market-grounded decisions. Janus-Q attempts to align event understanding and trading actions through structured supervision and reward design.",
  "methodology_summary": "Stage I builds event records with event type, stock, sentiment semantics, and CAR from market-model and risk-neutralized abnormal returns (Eq. 1-5). Stage II applies SFT then GRPO with HGRM combining hard direction gating, soft event-type gating, cost-aware PnL reward, magnitude shaping, and process reward (Eq. 6-10; Algorithm 1).",
