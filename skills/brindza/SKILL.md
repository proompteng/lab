# Brindza

## Overview

This skill provides guidance on food-related naming conventions and product knowledge within the lab repository. Brindza (bryndza) is a traditional sheep milk cheese from Eastern Europe, continuing the repository's tradition of using food-related names for components.

## Naming Conventions

The lab repository uses food-related names for apps and services:

### Apps (Frontend Applications)
- `nata` - TypeScript HTTP function
- `baozi` - S2I builder image
- `alchimie` - Python-based application
- `froussard` - Web application
- `kabina` - Web application
- `reestr` - Web application
- `reviseur` - Web application

### Services (Backend/Microservices)
- `miel` - Go service for Alpaca Trading API integration
- `bumba` - Service component
- `eclair` - Service component
- `galette` - Service component
- `dernier` - Rails service

## Usage Guidelines

When creating new components in the lab repository:

1. **Choose food-related names** that are:
   - Easy to pronounce
   - Memorable
   - Culturally diverse (reflecting the international team)
   - Not already in use

2. **Maintain consistency** with the existing pattern:
   - Apps use food names
   - Services use food names
   - Keep names short and simple

3. **Document the component** with:
   - Clear README.md explaining purpose
   - Configuration instructions
   - Development and deployment guidelines

## Examples

Good food-related names for new components:
- Dairy: brindza, halloumi, paneer, queso
- Bread: focaccia, challah, naan, roti
- Sweets: halva, lokum, gulab, mochi
- Dishes: paella, kimchi, curry, tagine
