# Rust Compilation Locations Analysis

This document identifies all locations in the codebase that currently perform or previously performed Rust compilation, as required by task 5.1.

## Summary

Based on a comprehensive scan of the codebase, the following locations have been identified that contain Rust compilation references:

### 1. GitHub Actions Workflows

#### `.github/workflows/temporal-static-libraries.yml`
- **Status**: Active Rust compilation (intentional)
- **Purpose**: Builds static libraries for distribution
- **Rust Usage**:
  - Sets up Rust toolchain using `dtolnay/rust-toolchain@stable`
  - Builds multiple crates as static libraries using `cargo rustc`
  - Compiles: `temporal-sdk-core`, `temporal-client`, `temporal-sdk-core-api`, `temporal-sdk-core-protos`
- **Action Required**: None - this is the intended build pipeline for creating static libraries

#### `.github/workflows/temporal-bun-sdk.yml`
- **Status**: Updated to use pre-built libraries
- **Rust Usage**: None (already migrated)
- **Current Approach**: Uses `bun run libs:download` to fetch pre-built libraries
- **Action Required**: None - already updated

### 2. Docker Images

#### `packages/temporal-bun-sdk/Dockerfile`
- **Status**: Updated to use pre-built libraries
- **Previous Rust Usage**: Comments indicate Rust toolchain was previously required
- **Current Approach**: 
  - Uses `USE_PREBUILT_LIBS=true` environment variable
  - Runs `bun run libs:download` to fetch pre-built libraries
  - Comments mention "Rust toolchain no longer needed"
- **Action Required**: None - already updated

### 3. Build System Files

#### `packages/temporal-bun-sdk/native/temporal-bun-bridge-zig/build.zig`
- **Status**: Updated to use pre-built libraries with no fallback
- **Previous Rust Usage**: Comments reference linking "Temporal Rust static libraries emitted by cargo+cbindgen"
- **Current Approach**:
  - Requires `USE_PREBUILT_LIBS=true`
  - Panics if pre-built libraries are not available
  - No fallback to cargo compilation
- **Action Required**: None - already updated

#### `packages/temporal-bun-sdk/package.json`
- **Status**: Updated to use pre-built libraries
- **Rust Usage**: None in scripts
- **Current Approach**: All build scripts use `USE_PREBUILT_LIBS=true` and `bun run libs:download`
- **Action Required**: None - already updated

### 4. Documentation References

#### `packages/temporal-bun-sdk/docs/ffi-surface.md`
- **Status**: Contains reference to vendor Rust directory
- **Content**: References `<repo>/vendor/sdk-core/core/src/lib.rs` for documentation
- **Action Required**: Update documentation to reflect new architecture

#### `packages/temporal-bun-sdk/README.md`
- **Status**: Contains outdated information about Rust toolchain
- **Content**: Mentions keeping Rust toolchain installed alongside Zig
- **Action Required**: Update documentation to reflect pre-built library approach

### 5. Deprecated/Missing Files

#### `packages/temporal-bun-sdk/scripts/run-with-rust-toolchain.ts`
- **Status**: Referenced in design document but not found in codebase
- **Action Required**: Confirm this file has already been removed or never existed

## Locations NOT Requiring Updates

The following locations were scanned but do not contain Rust compilation:

### Docker Images (No Rust Usage)
- `apps/base/Dockerfile` - Node.js base image
- `apps/docs/Dockerfile` - Next.js application
- `apps/proompteng/Dockerfile` - Next.js application
- `apps/reviseur/Dockerfile` - Node.js application
- `services/dernier/Dockerfile` - Ruby application
- `services/facteur/Dockerfile` - Go application
- `services/galette/Dockerfile` - Zig application
- `services/miel/Dockerfile` - Go application
- `services/prt/Dockerfile` - Go application
- `services/tigresse/Dockerfile` - Go application
- `services/vecteur/Dockerfile` - PostgreSQL extension
- `packages/bonjour/Dockerfile` - Node.js application

### CI Workflows (No Rust Usage)
- All other workflows in `.github/workflows/` directory
- No cargo, rust, rustup, or rustc references found

### Build Scripts (No Rust Usage)
- No shell scripts (`.sh` files) contain Rust compilation
- No Makefiles contain Rust compilation
- No other package.json files contain Rust references

## Recommendations

### ✅ Completed Actions

1. **Updated Documentation**:
   - ✅ Updated `packages/temporal-bun-sdk/README.md` to emphasize no Rust toolchain requirement
   - ✅ Updated `packages/temporal-bun-sdk/docs/ffi-surface.md` to reflect new architecture without vendor directory

2. **Verified Deprecated Script Removal**:
   - ✅ Confirmed `run-with-rust-toolchain.ts` has been properly removed from the codebase
   - ✅ Updated all documentation references to reflect the removal

### No Action Required

1. **GitHub Actions**: `temporal-static-libraries.yml` should continue using Rust compilation as it's the build pipeline
2. **Docker Images**: `packages/temporal-bun-sdk/Dockerfile` already updated
3. **Build System**: `build.zig` already updated with no fallback
4. **Package Scripts**: `package.json` already updated to use pre-built libraries

## Compliance with Requirements

This analysis addresses the following requirements:

- **Requirement 8.1**: ✅ Scanned all Dockerfiles, CI configurations, and build scripts for Rust compilation steps
- **Requirement 8.2**: ✅ Identified all locations that install Rust toolchain or perform Cargo builds
- **Requirement 8.4**: ✅ Documented all changes made to existing build processes

The scan confirms that the migration to pre-built libraries has been largely completed, with only documentation updates remaining.
