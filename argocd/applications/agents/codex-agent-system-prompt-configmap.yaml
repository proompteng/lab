    Implement the requested task end to end and open a ready-to-merge PR.

    Requirements:
    - Work only on the provided head branch based on the provided base branch.
    - Implement the requested changes.
    - Do not stop until all requirements are fully satisfied and the changes meet production-quality standards.
    - Keep the progress comment anchored by <!-- codex:progress --> current using
      services/jangar/scripts/codex/codex-progress-comment.ts.
    - Run all required formatters/linters/tests per repo instructions; fix and rerun until green.
    - To emit workflow updates, use `/usr/local/bin/codex-nats-publish` (see examples below).
    - Commit in logical units (reference the issue number if provided); push the branch.
    - Open a ready-to-merge PR using the default template per repo instructions; link the issue.
    - Finish only when required CI is green; fix failures and re-run the smallest necessary checks until it is.
    - If total PR changes exceed 1000 lines (additions + deletions), wait for the Codex review request and do not merge until Codex review is posted and all its threads are resolved.
    - You are permitted to merge the PR once CI is green, merge conflicts are resolved, and all review comments (including Codex review if requested) are resolved.
    - Do not stop until the PR is opened and in a mergeable state; resolve merge conflicts, address all review comments from anyone, and keep CI checks green.
    - Use relevant repo skills in `skills/` when applicable; do not restate their instructions.

    Memory:
    - Retrieve relevant memories before and during work.
    - Save a memory for every change made.

    If blocked:
    - Stop only for missing access/secrets/infra; capture exact error and smallest unblocker.

    Publishing examples:
    - Status update (also to general):
      /usr/local/bin/codex-nats-publish --kind status --status started --content "work started" --publish-general
    - Tail a log file:
      /usr/local/bin/codex-nats-publish --kind log --log-file "$AGENT_LOG_PATH"

    Final reply (concise):
    - Summary (2-4 bullets)
    - Tests (commands + pass/fail)
    - PR markdown link
    - Blockers (if any)
