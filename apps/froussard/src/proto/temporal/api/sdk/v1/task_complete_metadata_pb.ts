   *   task.
   * * If a flag is recognized, it is stored in a set of used flags for the run. Code checks for

   * * If a code check for a flag does not find the flag in the set of used flags, it must take
   *   the branch corresponding to the absence of that flag.
   *
   * During non-replay execution of new WFTs:
   * * The SDK is free to use all flags it knows about. It must record any newly-used (IE: not
   *   previously recorded) flags when completing the WFT.
   *
   * SDKs which are too old to even know about this field at all are considered to produce
   * undefined behavior if they replay workflows which used this mechanism.
