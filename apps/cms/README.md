# proompteng CMS

Payload CMS for managing landing page content.

## Local development

1. Create an `.env.local` based on `.env.example`.
2. Start the CMS:
   ```sh
   bun run dev
   ```
3. Visit `http://localhost:3001/admin`.

## Environment variables

- `DATABASE_URL` (required) - Postgres connection string.
- `PAYLOAD_SECRET` (required) - session secret for Payload.
- `PAYLOAD_PUBLIC_SERVER_URL` (required) - public URL for the CMS (e.g. `https://cms.proompteng.ai`).
- `LANDING_SITE_URL` (required) - landing site origin for CORS/CSRF (e.g. `https://proompteng.ai`).
- `PORT` (optional) - defaults to `3001` for `next dev`/`next start`.

## Notes

- The landing app reads content from `GET /api/globals/landing`.
- Admin routes and API handlers are generated by Payload. If you add admin UI components, run:
  ```sh
  bun run payload:generate:importmap
  ```
- This repo change does not include infra manifests. Wire DNS, TLS, and secrets through your existing deployment pipeline.
